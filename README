This plugin aims at providing an UI inside Geany to interact with Git
repositories.  It is currently lacking a lot of features and basically only
provides an history view allowing to browse a file's history and see the diffs
between many things.


Building
========

This package use regular Autotools, so you just need to run them.  The
requirements are:

* A C compiler (e.g. gcc);
* autoconf;
* automake;
* libtool;
* make;
* GTK2 development files (`libgtk2.0-dev` on Debian);
* Geany development files (inside the `geany` package on Debian).

Now, prepare the build system::

    $ ./autogen.sh

and then configure::

    $ ./configure

and finally, build it::

    $ make

Don't run `make install`, it won't do anything sensible for now.  You need to
manually install the plugin file.  Next steps will install the plugin in your
user's Geany configuration directory, if you want to install it system-wide,
just update the paths accordingly.  First, make sure the target directory
actually exists::

    $ [ -d ~/.config/geany/plugins/ ] || mkdir ~/.config/geany/plugins/

and then, ask Libtool to install it, performing any required modifications on
it::

    $ libtool --mode install install .libs/libgeany-git-ui.so ~/.config/geany/plugins/


Using it
========

Enable the plugin in Geany's plugin manager dialog.  A new tab labeled "Git"
will appear on the left pane, and will display the history of the current file
if it is inside a Git repository.
